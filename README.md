# Line_following_car_fpga_implementation_vhdl
Aim of this project is to design a line following car using external components and BASYS 3 FPGA board to implement the digital circuit design. It is aimed to exploit all the digital design sources instructed in EE102 digital circuit design lecture (VHDL language, BASYS 3 board and concepts of digital circuit design). It is planned to design a digital control circuit on the FPGA board with VHDL to control the car and realize the line following feature of the car.
